Scrabble Solver
===============

This was for a final project at Iowa State University (CPRE388)

Shown below are the requirements for the project:
-------------------------------------------------
Create a utility app that will help people cheat when playing Scrabble. 
Requirements: 
	-(30 points) A set of four activities: the scrabble board, a list of word plays, an anagram solver and a preferences screen. 
	-(30 points) The anagram solver activity allows the user to enter 7 letters (including blank tiles), and will find words that contain those letters from a dictionary. 
	-(30 points) The scrabble board activity allows the user to input their 7 letters, plus the contents of the board. 
	-(20 points) The board can be solved using a small dictionary in a reasonable amount of time, with the results listed on the 2nd activity. When selecting a result, the word is shown on the scrabble board. 
	-(40 points) The preferences activity will allow the user to choose from a few dictionaries (large and small) as well as switch between the original Scrabble board and the Words with Friends board. 
Optional Features: 
	-Use a DAWG (directed acyclic word graph) for storing the dictionaries. 
	-Solve a complex board using a 100,000+ dictionary (TWL) in less than 1 second.
